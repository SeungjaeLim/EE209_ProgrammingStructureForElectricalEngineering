-
It is impossible to know allocated size of destination only have information of pointer, 
so we can't call assert to avoid size of destination is smaller than source.
(I think if destination is allocated malloc, 
then when StrCopy call realloc size of source to avoid it, not assert)
I implemented part 1 only with pointer notation.
  - I use const char *pc instead of const char c[] 
  - I use pc++ to use pointer instead of index i
  - I accessed to *p intead of c[i]
  - I checked end of String such that if(*p), because *p is '\0' when end of string
